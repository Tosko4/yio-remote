# Setting up your environment

The software of the remote is written in [Qt](https://www.qt.io/). In order to get the code running on your machine you should download and install Qt for Windows, Mac or Linux the [Qt open source license edition](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer). When running the installer, make sure you select the following components (versions at the time of writing this document):

  - Qt 5.12.3
  - MinGW 7.3.0 64-bit
  - Sources
  - Qt Virtual Keyboard
  - Qt Debug Information Files
  
The Developer and Designer Tools are preselected and you can leave that.

> In case you need to add, remove or change components post-install, open the file "MaintenanceTool.exe" in the root of the Install directory (C:\Qt by default)

After setting up your environment you can continue to configure your [remote app](./remote%20app) project according to the information over there.
